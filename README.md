Stratus3D

An Elixir assertion library that utilizes the [Erlang library teal](https://github.com/Stratus3D/teal).

The name was inspired by the color assigned to Elixir in the GitHub web interface. The color appears to be very close to [French Lilac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilac_(color\)#French_lilac)
